	<p>A home electrical service, often referred to as an electrical
		service or electrical panel, is a crucial component of a residential
		electrical system. It's the main distribution point where electricity
		from the utility company enters your home and is distributed to
		various circuits, outlets, and appliances throughout the house. The
		electrical service panel is typically located in a utility room,
		basement, garage, or an exterior wall of the home.</p>
